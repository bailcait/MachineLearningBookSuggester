# MachineLearningGoodreads
Creating a machine learning model to be able to recommend a book to a user based on their bookshelf.
Was not able to upload the saved version of the final tree that we used. In order to get a book recomendation from this model you will need to run it locally and use the saved tree that it makes. The tree with only 100 users takes roughly 5.5 hours to build. Data can be found in the +allbooks.txt file. Would strongly suggest cutting the data down to 100 lines instead of 900 when using it to run.
